### üìÅ Effortlessly sync configuration files
Sync files like `.netrc` or `.npmrc` across your projects with ease without having to manually copy them around. This is secure as you won't be creating new auth tokens always. This saves times as you won't need to search for your old tokens again. 

Manage tokens all at one place and sync them across your projects.
